#EasyA

##Description
a website that tells the user what the workload of a Cornell class they want to take is. 

##How does it work
This is accomplished through aggregation of data collected from sites such as RateMyProfessor.com and applying an quasi-machine learning algorithm.

##Specifications
To specify your search, you are prompted with input fields for your professor, the course you are interested in and the grade you desire.

##Makeup
The back-end is written in Node.js (using the rmp-api, fast-csv, express, common-words, and body-parser modules) while the front-end and GUI is written in HTML & CSS with Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery.

##Future implmentation
Larger database, extended to different universities
