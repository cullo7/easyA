Easy A is a website that tells the user what the workload of a Cornell class they want to take is. 
This is accomplished through aggregation of data collected from sites such as RateMyProfessor.com and applying an algorithm. 
The factors are the professor, course, and desired grade. 
The site is built with Node.js (using the rmp-api, fast-csv, express, common-words, and body-parser modules)
Written in Hypertext Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript.
